         <p class="section-2_p">The program responsible for the unprecedented flock to solar in 2024 could be coming to
            an end. Until recently, people had no reasonable alternative but to shell out whatever the price gouging
            electric companies charged in order to keep the lights on.

         <p class="section-2_p">Everything changed when the government approved a bill making it a no-brainer for
            homeowners in specific zip codes to ditch their power companies and switch to solar.

         <p class="section-2_p">Through this aggressive energy relief program, millions of homeowners have been able to

         <p class="section-2_p">The greedy power companies are sparing no expense to end the program in hopes of keeping
            their unhappy customers from following their neighbors over to solar. With their deep pockets and strong
            political allies, it appears they may get their wish.</p>
         <p class="section-2_p">The situation has caused an urgency for homeowners in approved zip codes to switch
            before they are stuck paying the relentless price increases year after year while their solar powered
            neighbors don’t even notice the hikes.</p>

         <p class="section-2_p">As energy prices continue to skyrocket with no end in sight, the U.S. solar industry saw
            a staggering a 47% increase from Q1 2022 to Q1 2023, and almost every single convert took advantage of the
            program.</p>
         <p class="section-2_p">Homeowners are urged to check eligibility and see how much they will save. The harsh
            truth is that many households won’t act in time and be stuck with crushing energy bills that only go up year
            after year.</p>
